# Milestone Project 1 

This is my first project for Code Institute. The website is a resume allowing future employers to get to know more about me and being able to have a look at my skills and previous work experience. 
The site is made up of 4 pages and has a link in which you can download my CV from for those who are looking for a deeper dive. 

The Home page consists of an introductory paragraph along with a picture of myself and my personal details below. #
The My Skills page shows my education and work history along with the different coding languages I will learn with Code Institute. 
The portfolio page shows all the mini projects I have completed so far. 
Finally, there is a contact page which has a form which allows prospective employers or other web developers to get in touch with me. 

## UX

This project is for potential employers, potential clients, and other web developers to see what my main skills are and allows them to get in touch with me if they want more information or want to collaborate on a project. 

### User Stories 

•	As an employer I want to be able to see my previous education, work history and to see if I have the necessary skills. 
•	As a potential client I want to be able to view my previous projects 
•	As a web developer I want to be able to get in contact to try and collaborate on future projects.

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes on Figma. 
I first designed the basic layout of the webpages, once that was done I started adding colours to see how it would look before deciding on my final colour scheme.

## Features 

Feature 1 – Nav Bar – Allows users to easily navigate through the website. Within the navbar there is a Download CV option which when clicked will download my CV for the user to read
Feature 2 – Contact Form – This page allows users to get in contact with me, form currently doesn’t have a mailto action, so when the submit button is pressed, the website will refresh instead
Feature 3 – Footer – The footer contains all the links to my social media pages as well as a link download button which allows them to download my CV in a pdf format. 
Feature 4 – Portfolio Page – This page shows my current projects I have completed with Code Institute. There is a screenshot of the project homepage as well as a short description about the project. When the user clicks on the screenshot, the project will open in a new tab allowing the user to view the website. 
Feature 5 – Timelines – On the My Skills page there is a timeline which shows the user my education history and work history. The timeline is complete with dates to show the user how long I have been working for as well as how long I have been studying for. 

### Features left to implement

A future feature that I would like to implement would be to add a mailto function so in the future I can receive the content from the contact form when submitted.

### colours

The pages follow a standard colour scheme with only a few colours being used throughout the whole sight, the colours that were used are listed below:
#BA55D3 - Purple
#FFFFFF - White
#FFFF00 - Yellow
#C4C4C4 – Light Grey


### Font

Throughout the website, I decided to use 1 font as I thought I would look better than having 2 -3 different fonts. The font I used was Exo as I believed It looked the best out of all the fonts.
