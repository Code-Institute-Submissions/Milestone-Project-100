# Milestone Project 1 

This is my first project for Code Institute. The website is a resume allowing future employers to get to know more about me and being able to have a look at my skills and previous work experience. 
The site is made up of 4 pages and has a link in which you can download my CV from for those who are looking for a deeper dive. 

The Home page consists of an introductory paragraph along with a picture of myself and my personal details below. #
The My Skills page shows my education and work history along with the different coding languages I will learn with Code Institute. 
The portfolio page shows all the mini projects I have completed so far. 
Finally, there is a contact page which has a form which allows prospective employers or other web developers to get in touch with me. 

## UX

This project is for potential employers, potential clients, and other web developers to see what my main skills are and allows them to get in touch with me if they want more information or want to collaborate on a project. 

### User Stories 

•	As an employer I want to be able to see my previous education, work history and to see if I have the necessary skills. 
•	As a potential client I want to be able to view my previous projects 
•	As a web developer I want to be able to get in contact to try and collaborate on future projects.

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes on Figma. 
I first designed the basic layout of the webpages, once that was done I started adding colours to see how it would look before deciding on my final colour scheme.
