# Milestone Project 1 

This is my first project for Code Institute. The website is a resume allowing future employers to get to know more about me and being able to have a look at my skills and previous work experience. 
The site is made up of 4 pages and has a link in which you can download my CV from for those who are looking for a deeper dive. 

The Home page consists of an introductory paragraph along with a picture of myself and my personal details below. #
The My Skills page shows my education and work history along with the different coding languages I will learn with Code Institute. 
The portfolio page shows all the mini projects I have completed so far. 
Finally, there is a contact page which has a form which allows prospective employers or other web developers to get in touch with me.
